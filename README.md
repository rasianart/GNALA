Data construction, deconstruction, reconstruction.  Translation from visual, to auditory, to multi-sensory, multi-lingual output.  GNALA abstracts the objectivity of data and information.  

Beginning with language/text, visual content is then generated. The visual results populate UI nodes, which then are dragged through processing nodes for distortion effects.  Upon singularity processing, audio data is transmitted, followed by a reconifguration of image, color, and lingual data.  

There is a beauty in translation, a witnessing of the remaining fragments through their absence, or re-imagined forms.
